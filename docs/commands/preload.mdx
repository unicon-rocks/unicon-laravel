Unicon provides the `icons:preload` to preload all icons on deployment.

```bash
php artisan icons:preload
```

While Unicon will hapilly fetch icons on-demand, this command will ensure that
even the first render of an icon will be as fast as possible, because they will
be pulled from the cache instead of the Iconify API.

## Caveats

This command performs a recursive regex search on all the Blade files in your
application. This means that only icons that are statically defined in the
Blade file will be found.

| Will be found ✅ | Will not be found ❌ |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| `<x-icon name="noto:unicorn" />` | `<x-icon name="{{ $icon }}" />` |
| `<x-icon name="heroicons:clock" />` | `<x-icon :name="$name" />` |

<Tip>
Icons whose name is dynamically defined will have to be fetched on-demand
the very first time they are rendered, and subsequent renders will be cached
all the same.
